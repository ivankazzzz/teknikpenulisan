Guide for Authors
Manuscript Submission Overview
The Humanities Journal publishes 4 types of articles: 

• Original research articles: original manuscripts (maximum 7,500 words) that contain new research findings in any field of knowledge.

• Short Communications: short manuscripts (maximum 3,000 words) describing new findings or research information intended to disseminate this information rapidly. The Editorial Board will expedite the review process of this type of manuscript.

• Review Articles and Mini-Reviews: 

A review article (review article: maximum 10.000 words. mini-review: maximum 3.000 ) analyzes and summarizes existing information on a specific topic, without presenting new experimental data. It provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in an area and identifies gaps or trends, helping researchers quickly understand a field of study and pointing out directions for future research.

The number of words mentioned above for all types of articles does not consider the figures and tables for all types of articles, but references should be included in the total. The Editorial Board reserves its right to waive the word limit, although a request may be made to the Editor-in-Chief before submitting the manuscript.

• Theoretical Articles/Opinion: Theoretical articles and opinion articles (maximum 5,000 words) aim to develop new theories or expand existing ones, providing innovative perspectives on established concepts. These articles delve into the conceptual foundations of a field, proposing new frameworks, models, or hypotheses. Authors are encouraged to engage critically with existing literature, offering original insights and arguments that advance theoretical understanding. Opinion pieces may also present personal viewpoints on current debates, trends, or emerging issues in the discipline. Both types of articles stimulate intellectual discourse, challenge conventional wisdom, and inspire future research directions. Authors should ensure clarity, coherence, and a strong argumentative basis in their contributions.
