0. Guide for using this Template

This template provides a comprehensive guide on the sections that can be included in a manuscript. It is important to note that while some sections are mandatory, others are optional. The section titles provided in the template are intended for Short Communications and Research Articles, and it is worth mentioning that other article types may have a more adaptable structure. For Review Articles and Mini-Reviews, the "Materials and Methods", "Results" and "Discussion" sections, authors are free to adapt the textual structure of their type of article, being able to remove or modify these sections.
Note 1: Kindly avoid making any changes to the header and footer.
Note 2: Remove this section so that the first session of the study is the Introduction.

	Introduction

Insert text (Calibri font, size 10, and single-line spacing).
The Introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important and necessary. It should provide a general background of the study, define a problem, emphasize the purpose/justification for its execution, and present a clear and concise study objective. Hypotheses should also be addressed here.
The current state of the research field should be carefully reviewed, and key publications, especially recent ones, should be cited. The Introduction should be comprehensible and connect the points mentioned above with a dynamic flow of reading, making it accessible to scientists outside of the specific research field. Citations should be presented in parentheses, using only the last name of the first author followed by the year, without commas or periods.

Examples of citations:

Single author: The author's last name should always with the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase, whether it appears inside or outside parentheses. Examples: In the text: (Smith, 2019) or Smith (2019).

Two authors: When referencing an article authored by two individuals, include both authors' last names followed by the publication date each time you mention it in the text. Examples: In the text: Dantas and Souza-Junior (2023) or (Dantas & Souza-Junior, 2003).

Three or more authors: In cases where a work has three or more authors, only the last name of the first author should be used, followed by the Latin expression "et al.", and then the publication date. Examples: In the text: Ahmed et al. (2023) or (Ahmed et al., 2023).

The citation and reference formatting standard in the Humanities Journal follows the American Psychological Association (APA). See our Guide for Authors: https://www.malque.pub/ojs/index.php/hj/guide

	Materials and Methods

Insert text (Calibri font, size 10, and single-line spacing).
The Materials and Methods section should provide sufficient detail to allow others to replicate and build upon the published results. It is important to note that by submitting your manuscript for publication, you are required to make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Any restrictions on the availability of materials or information should be disclosed at the submission stage.
For new methods and protocols, please provide a comprehensive description. Well-established methods can be briefly summarized and appropriately referenced.
If your research manuscript includes large datasets that have been deposited in a publicly available database, please specify the location of the data deposition and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not been obtained at the time of submission, please indicate that they will be provided during the review process. However, they must be provided before publication.
For studies in which procedures with human or animal subjects, the authors must present a statement in the section “Ethical considerations” that the study correctly followed the ethical policies required by your institution/country/international community. For more details on how to report this, see "Publication and Research Ethics": https://malque.pub/ojs/index.php/hj/ethics.

Figures

Make sure that all figures are legible and of good quality. TIFF format offers higher-quality graphics. TIFF format can be used. Images, photos, and graphics are considered figures. The caption (title) should appear at the bottom of the picture. All Figures must be priorly called in the text (Figure 1, Figure 2...) before they appear. 
Note: Figures should be provided sequentially at the end of the manuscript, i.e., after the References section.
Follow the example below to create Figures: 

 
Figure 1 Insert text (Calibri font, size 9, and single-line spacing).

 
Figure 2 Insert text (Calibri font, size 9, and single-line spacing).

 
Figure 3 Insert text (Calibri font, size 9, and single-line spacing).

 
Figure 4 Insert text (Calibri font, size 9, and single-line spacing).

Tables

All tables must be numbered with Arabic numerals and should be cited in the text in numerical order. All tables must be priorly called in the text (Table 1, Table 2...) before they appear. For each table, provide a caption (title) at the top. Identify any previously published material by referencing the original source at the bottom of the table (footnote). Table footnotes should be indicated by superscript lowercase letters (or asterisks for significance values and other statistical data) and included in the table's body.
Note: Tables should be provided sequentially at the end of the manuscript, i.e., after the References section.
Follow the example below to create Tables:

The "Discussion" section of a research paper provides a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the study's results in the context of existing knowledge in the field. It is an opportunity for the researchers to delve deeper into the implications and significance of their findings, compare them with previous studies, and explore possible explanations for the observed outcomes. As the results are presented, make sure to cite references that justify, support, explain, or contradict the data evaluated and found in this study.
The authors critically evaluate their results in the discussion section, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, addressing any discrepancies or unexpected findings, and providing potential explanations or hypotheses. They may also discuss the limitations of the study, such as methodological constraints or potential sources of bias, and propose avenues for future research to elucidate the topic further. The discussion section often includes a synthesis of the key findings, relating them back to the research questions or objectives outlined in the Introduction.
