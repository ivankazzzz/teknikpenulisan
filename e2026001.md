1. Introduction
Emergency care is a very complex form of health care that requires a fast and accurate response. In emergency
conditions, time is a crucial factor that can determine the safety of the patient's life. Therefore, the ability to make the right
decision in a short time is a key requirement in this service. Nurses as an integral part of the emergency team have an important
role in clinical decision-making. Nurses not only carry out doctor's orders, but are also responsible for the initial assessment,
identification of priorities, and implementation of initial life-saving measures (Alshahrani, 2024). In practice, nurses are often
the first health workers to assess and intervene with emergency patients.
However, in many countries including Indonesia, decision-making by nurses is still not fully supported by a strong policy
system. Many nurses are still bound by narrow boundaries of authority, hindering the speed of responding to critical patient
conditions. In fact, this role is very strategic to improve the efficiency and quality of care. Optimizing the role of nurses in
decision-making does not only involve individual abilities, but is also strongly influenced by policies governing nursing practice.
Policies that are not adaptive to the dynamics of the field may prevent nurses from acting independently and professionally in
emergency situations (Arra et al., 2023).
In developed countries such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, there are many policies that give
nurses more autonomy in the ED, including in making clinical decisions based on protocols or algorithms. This shows that with
supportive policies, nurses are able to make a significant contribution to improving patient outcomes (Woo et al., 2017).
Meanwhile, in Indonesia, regulations related to nursing practice have indeed developed, such as the Nursing Law No. 38/2014.
However, implementation in the field still faces various challenges, such as the lack of specific training, the absence of national
competency standards for ER nurses, and the lack of a supervision system based on nurse clinical decision evaluation.
Health policies that address nurses' decision-making practices in the ED need to consider various aspects, including the
legal framework, ethical aspects, clinical competencies, and documentation mechanisms. Without a comprehensive policy
approach, decision-making by nurses may become a gray area that poses risks to patient safety and the legal protection of
nurses themselves. In addition, in the context of globalization and the demands of international accreditation, hospitals in
Indonesia are also required to improve the quality of emergency services in line with global standards. One important indicator
is the ability of the ED team, including nurses, to make clinical judgment quickly and accurately. This can only be achieved if
the system supports nurses to make competency-based decisions (Tipsmark et al., 2023).
Abstract Nurses play a critical role in emergency departments, where timely and independent clinical decision -making is
essential. However, their ability to make decisions is heavily influenced by the policy frameworks that govern their practice.
This study aims to review and compare national policy frameworks that support nurses’ clinical decision -making in
emergency care settings, with a focus on four countries. A structured policy review was conducted using six major databases
and repositories, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, WHO IRIS, the Indonesian Ministry of Health, ICN, and PPNI. The search
focused on documents published between 2014 and 2024. Following the PRISMA 2020 flow, four policy documents met the
inclusion criteria and were selected for final synthesis, each representing Indonesia, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the
United States. The findings reveal that while Indonesia has basic legal provisions for nursing roles, it lacks operational
policies that enable clinical autonomy in emergency settings. In contrast, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States have more advanced frameworks that include protocol -based authority, standardized training, and structured
interdisciplinary collaboration for emergency nurses. Strengthening Indonesia’s emergency nursing policies requires
adopting best practices from countries with more developed systems. Expanding nurses’ clinical authority, formalizing
competency-based training, and integrating decision-making protocols are essential to improve responsiveness and quality
of care in emergency departments.

Therefore, a policy review is needed to evaluate the extent to which existing regulations have accommodated the
optimization of nurses' role in decision-making in the ED. This review can also serve as a basis for strategic policy making that
is more favorable to strengthening the professional role of nurses in the health system. By conducting a review of applicable
policies, both nationally and internationally, it is expected that gaps, opportunities, and recommendations can be found that
can be used to formulate future policy directions. Optimizing the role of nurses in decision-making is not only a professional
need, but is part of a strategy to improve the quality of emergency services in Indonesia.
2. Materials and Methods
This study employed a structured policy review design, aiming to evaluate national and international regulations
relevant to emergency nursing practice, particularly in relation to clinical decision-making. The review followed the general
principles of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework for document
selection and reporting, although this review was not a full systematic review.
The search strategy involved identifying publicly available policy documents, government regulations, professional
association guidelines, and relevant peer-reviewed literature published between 2014 and 2024. The primary sources included
the Indonesian Ministry of Health website, WHO policy repositories, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and official documents from
professional nursing organizations (e.g., ICN, PPNI).
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) documents published within the last 10 years; (2) relevance to nursing practice in
emergency departments; (3) availability in English or Bahasa Indonesia; and (4) full-text accessibility. Exclusion criteria included
documents focused solely on non-nursing clinical disciplines or lacking clear policy content. Data extraction focused on
identifying policy content that addressed nurses’ roles, clinical authority, education, interprofessional collaboration, and
documentation practices in the ED context.
The document selection process followed the PRISMA 2020 framework. A total of 128 records were identified through
six databases: PubMed (n = 38), ScienceDirect (n = 27), WHO IRIS (n = 18), the Indonesian Ministry of Health (n = 22), the
International Council of Nurses (ICN) (n = 13), and the Indonesian National Nurses Association (PPNI) (n = 10). After removing
35 duplicates, 93 records were screened, and 71 were excluded based on title and abstract. Of the 22 reports sought for
retrieval, 2 could not be accessed in full text. A total of 20 full-text documents were assessed for eligibility, and 16 were
excluded for not focusing on clinical nursing decision-making (n = 12) or for lacking relevant policy content (n = 4). Ultimately,
4 documents were included in the final review, each representing a national policy framework from Indonesia, Australia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States (Figure 1).

3. Results and Discussion
The findings are categorized into two major components: (1) Factors Influencing Nurses' Clinical Decision-Making, and
(2) National and International Policy Frameworks. Table 1 summarizes the key differences in policy frameworks supporting
nurse autonomy in emergency departments across selected countries. The comparison illustrates the varying degrees of nurse
empowerment, clinical protocol authorization, and competency requirements.

Synthesizing the policy environment with influencing factors (e.g., nurse experience, technology access,
interprofessional collaboration) reveals that while structural support exists in high-resource countries, Indonesia still faces
implementation gaps at the operational level.
The nursing care process is generally unchanged in each group as it is standardized; however, the choices most often
made in the ED may differ from other units, taking into account the specific nature of the patient and the environment. A
recent study suggested there are three types of clinical decision activities performed by critical care nurses: intervention,
communication, and evaluation. These three categories of clinical decision activities will prompt nurses to formulate new
decisions or maintain existing decisions.
3.1. Intervention decisions In the emergency department
Patients are generally total care patients; therefore intervention decisions are probably one of the most common
decisions made by nurses. found intervention decisions made by critical care nurses involved such issues as positioning,
suctioning, and several other aspects of direct patient care. Nurses may decide on new interventions when they start new
therapies or modify existing patient care, or they may continue with 'old' interventions. Intervention decisions are nursing
activities to modify the patient (Flynn et al., 2012).
Intervention decisions refer to nurses' autonomous actions in modifying or initiating care in response to patient needs.
In countries like Australia and the UK, national clinical guidelines empower nurses to conduct interventions based on standing
orders or care bundles. Conversely, in Indonesia, while emergency nurses are trained in basic life-saving interventions, policy
support for independent action remains limited and often depends on physician directives. This restricts rapid responses in
time-sensitive conditions. Prior literature emphasizes that enabling intervention autonomy improves outcomes, especially
during golden hours (Woo et al., 2017).
3.2. Communication decisions
Communication is one of the central components in a critical care unit: it is important that nursing care nurses
communicate with colleagues, other healthcare professionals, patients and their families. Explaining that different types of
communication are evident in the ED, which involves investigating a patient's condition by the healthcare team, offering
support, and relaying information about that patient's current condition to other staff and family members. Suggesting that
nurses perform new communication decisions if they initiate communication with other team members or family members,
while only old communication decisions will occur if they follow up on existing communication decisions (Ubbink et al., 2024).
Communication forms the backbone of coordinated care in the ED. Nurses often function as information hubs, relaying
critical data among multidisciplinary teams. However, the degree of autonomy in initiating communication varies across
systems. In countries with clear documentation standards (e.g., NHS UK), nurses are expected to initiate interdisciplinary
communication. In Indonesia, poor communication is cited as a barrier to effective emergency response (MOH, 2016),
indicating a need for standard operating procedures and clearer policy mandates.
3.3. Evaluation decisions
Evaluation is another type of judgment, which seems to be done frequently in emergency departments, while
predominantly caring for unconscious patients. Critical care nurses continuously observe the patient's status, categorize data
based on its relevance and importance; they validate and organize data, identify patterns and correlations, make inferences,
4
Saharuddin et al. (2026)
https://www.malque.pub/ojs/index.php/hj
formulate hypotheses and evaluate them, one of the main roles of nurses is to assess patient change, and indeed so followed
by managing change (Khairina et al., 2018).
Evaluation decisions involve nurses' critical thinking and clinical judgment, particularly in monitoring changes and
anticipating deterioration. In high-resource settings, structured tools like MEWS and SBAR are policy-mandated and embedded
in nursing protocols. In Indonesia, although such tools exist in training modules, there is no national requirement for their
routine application, creating variability in decision-making quality (Khairina et al., 2018). Strengthening policy alignment with
evidence-based evaluation frameworks is essential.
3.4. Factors influencing decision-making in the emergency department
There are various aspects that are believed to be controlling factors for clinical judgment and decisions. Several studies
investigated these factors, viz: nurse experience, patient condition, personnel resources, shift work, ED layout, technology in
the ED, inter-professional collaboration, accountability, and authority.
3.4.1. Nurse experience
In most clinical settings, nursing experience seems to be a significant factor in the decision-making process, and this
seems to be true in the ICU. conducted a study using a natural design that found that nurses' experience influenced their
decision-making process. Researchers showed that nurses with more than five years of experience were more likely to
communicate their decisions to others. This may be because experienced nurses are more likely to be assigned to patients with
more complicated conditions than less experienced nurses, and experienced nurses are generally responsible for assisting less
experienced nurses. Thus, experienced nurses are required to communicate more frequently through setting treatment
options, checking patient progress, and teaching options for patient management (Jala et al., 2023). In contrast, nurses with
less than five years of experience tend to make evaluative decisions. This result may be due to their difficulty in identifying
whether data is important and relevant, or unimportant or irrelevant, so they continue to focus on finding trends in patient
monitors.
Nurses' experience is believed to be the most influential factor in the decision-making process, especially when using
intuition. Bjørk et al. argue that education, gender, age, and field of practice might influence the use of interpretative-intuitive
CDM; however, the main influencing factor is experience. Less experienced nurses differ from experienced nurses in their
ability to analyze data and make decisions. Discussing experience is an influential factor, it is important for nurse managers to
consider this factor when organizing nursing shifts (Wighus & Bjørk, 2018). Bucknall argues that it is vital to create an
appropriate combination of personnel on each shift, based on their experience; so that effective clinical decision-making can
be maintained at all times, 24 hours a day. Bucknall also pointed out that experienced nurses may find it a challenge to convey
adequate information and share opinions, to support novices in deciding whether they are responsible for too many students
at the time (Nibbelink & Brewer, 2018).
3.4.2. Nurse knowledge
Nurses' knowledge can contribute to decision-making in the ICU. Nurses' knowledge can affect their performance in
decision-making. Pointing out several factors such as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about sedation, previous experience,
and clinical judgment skills could all influence nurses' judgment and decision making. They argued that nurses' knowledge of a
wide variety of content and attributes related to issues such as assessment, physiology, and treatment affect their ability in
clinical judgment and decision-making in sedation management (Ubbink et al., 2024). They further asserted that nurses do not
really take into account physiological factors before making clinical decisions; this 'blind spot' may indicate a lack of
understanding of physiology, or it may reflect that before making intervention decisions, experts do not need conscious
consideration related to physiology.
3.4.3. Patient condition
The complexity of the patient's situation may influence the type of decisions and decisions have to be made. Nurses'
clinical decision-making is generally influenced by the patient's health status. Complications of the patient's condition affect
the speed, form, and complexity of decisions. She argues that nurses may experience a lack of confidence when caring for
patients with rare presentation situations; self-perception, which may affect the speed of the decision-making process.
Furthermore, she also points out that nurses can gain confidence deciding if they have the opportunity to discuss their case
with more experienced nursing people. that the patient's situation can affect the type of decision the nurse makes; it could be
an intervention decision, a communication decision, an evaluation decision, or a combination of all these (Walzl et al., 2021).
Contributing factors in decision-making for sedation management in the ED includes medical history, current health
status, anxiety, sedation level, patient response to therapy, family influence, and sedation management outcomes for each
patient. They also showed sedation assessment and management was largely determined by the patient's neurological status;
which was more influential in sedation assessment and management than pain and comfort. This may be because the data
5
Saharuddin et al. (2026)
https://www.malque.pub/ojs/index.php/hj
collected from neurological status assessment was more objective than the results of comfort status evaluation (Flynn et al.,
2012). However, the goal is that pain assessment is improved by using measurement tools such as the numerical rating scale
(NRS), or behavioral pain scale (BPS). Studies found positive effects of applying the tools in the field of clinical assessment and
decision-making. By using background knowledge and experience nurses may be able to transcribe the results of assessment
tools to make robust clinical judgments.
3.4.4. Emergency department layout
The design of the emergency department can affect nurses' clinical decision-making. Bucknall considers that nurses
working in a closed room layout tend to communicate less with other team members, compared to nurses working in an open
design. She argues that the final plan might increase nurses' independence when deciding as they tend to communicate with
other team members only when necessary. Nurses working in final layouts tend to make fewer communication decisions than
other types of decisions. Furthermore, Bucknall points out that open-plan critical care units can accommodate both patients
and healthcare providers, whereas confined and less convenient layouts might trigger nurse stress and might work against the
quality of the decision-making process (Blackburn et al., 2019).
3.4.5. Work shifts
The type and process of clinical decisions made by nurses are also affected by shift work. Previous studies found that
work decisions made by nurses on night duty are mostly evaluation-type decisions: there are fewer interventions and
communications during night hours, in order to preserve the patient's quality of sleep. Another reason why nurses don't make
as many communication decisions during night shifts is the decreased participation of other healthcare professionals during
that time (Alinaza, 2024; Walzl et al., 2021).
3.4.6. Interprofessional collaboration
Multidisciplinarity can influence many nurses' clinical decisions in a way that nurses' attitudes towards interprofessional
collaboration may depend on them being guaranteed a role in the decision-making team. Bucknall argues that multidisciplinary
interprofessional collaboration is fundamental in making interprofessional decisions. She argues that nurses with adequate
knowledge feel more confident to enter discussions with other health professionals; furthermore, physicians rely more on
nurses to continue evaluations during non-regular working hours; especially if they decide to follow-up care based on the
nurse's information (Ubbink et al., 2024; Hess et al., 2015).
3.4.7. Physical resources and personnel
Nurse resources and advanced technological equipment in the ED may influence the clinical decision-making process.
The ability of nurses in using advanced technology might support them in making effective clinical decisions, It is also often
suggested that staffing resources are a significant influence on making; a shortage of nurses may increase workload, and this
may affect the time available to make decisions (Reay et al., 2019).
3.5. Problem Identification
1. There is still a low number of nurses with emergency department certificates
2. There is still a lack of communication between peers regarding emergency interventions
3. Lack of technology informatics facilities regarding technology-based referrals.
4. Inability of nurses to collaborate between doctors.
3.6. Urgency of the Problem
1. Hospitals or the Government have not provided regular facilities for emergency department training.
2. Some nurses do not understand independent intervention and collaboration in the emergency department.
3. Hospitals have not provided informatics technology facilities to facilitate quick referrals.
4. Doctors and nurses lack balance in collaboration, especially with specialists
3.7. Cause of the problem
1. There are no strategic measures for emergency department training in hospitals
2. Nurses do not understand the emergency department policy in the hospital.
3. Technology-based services in hospitals are not yet optimal
4. There is no balance of authority and intervention in interprofessional collaboration
3.8. Existing Policies
6

1. Regulation of the Indonesian Minister of Health Number 19 of 2016 concerning Integrated Emergency Management
System.
2. Minister of Health regulation number 129 of 2008 concerning minimum service standards for hospital emergency
departments.
3. Accreditation Standard Policy of the Ministry of Health Standard TKRS.3.1 on effective communication.
4. Ministry of Health Accreditation Standard Policy Standart PPA on Interprofessional collaboration.
5. Ministry of Health Regulation No 20 of 2019 concerning the implementation of telemedicine services between health
service facilities.
6. Ministry of Health Regulation No 20 of 2019 does not specifically explain the implementation of telehealth and its
integration with other telehealth. in article 10 (3) which states that in the event that a health service facility requests a
consultation. consultation can be carried out by a midwife or nurse in accordance with statutory regulations.
7. Nurses or doctors in remote villages in Law No. 90 of 2015 related to remote villages with the existence of telehealth
are able to increase health care coverage for long distances such as in rural, small, or sparsely populated areas.
3.9. Policy Recommendations
1. The Hospital provides regular and updated emergency training.
2. Improve the implementation of more innovative socialization services as well as utilizing various kinds of media that
can display information in a more interesting and informative manner and are easy to understand.
3. Interprofessional collaboration system needs to be held to equalize perceptions among health workers.
4. Increase collaboration and integration in technology-based services
4. Conclusions
This review reveals that the role of emergency nurses in clinical decision-making is not yet fully supported by policy
frameworks in Indonesia. Compared to countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States, Indonesia still
lacks detailed regulations, structured training, and systems that enable nurses to make timely and independent decisions in
emergency settings.
To strengthen emergency nursing practice, policies must focus on expanding clinical authority, developing competency-
based training, and ensuring interprofessional collaboration. Aligning with global standards will not only improve patient
outcomes but also enhance the professional role of nurses as key decision-makers in emergency care.
